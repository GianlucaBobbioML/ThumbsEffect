# ThumbsEffect
Different thumbs effects for non square imgs

Inside main.py you have all tried effects.

On the top of the script configure the file name (ie: `name = img.jpg`). The file must be on the same folder as the script.
On the bottom of the folder just run the desired effect (ie: `useBlurredAndResized()`).

To try the script, just step in the folder and run `python main.py`. The result will be stored on the same folder as the script.

### TODO
- Add argument for filename
- Add argument for desired effect
