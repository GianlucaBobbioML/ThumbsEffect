# ThumbsEffect
Different thumbs effects for non square imgs

Inside you all tried effects. 
On the top of the script configure the file name (ie: `name = img.jpg`). The file must be on the same folder as the script.
On the bottom of the folder just run the desired effect (ie: `useBlurredAndResized()`).

To try the script, just step in the folder and run `python main.py`.
